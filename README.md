===============
Sample app and proof of concept for the _PuppetMaster_ idea 

This repo contains a sample app, some automated tests, and code to process annotations that will be used as a playground for the *PuppetMaster* idea. 

The idea was short-listed as finalist for 2019 RisingStar Award - see [here](https://huddle.eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/rising-star-finalists-2019/).

Here is a link to the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DqcVnrcGM_aTg7O8UMaLlRoHgWvXn_b05R10JbCALo0/edit#slide=id.g40b2f68b54_0_37) that summarizes the concept that I want to implement. 

Hopefully this tool will benefit all the Android developer community by helping to generate automated tests that give a desired level of coverage by using the Process Cycle Test technique 

Here is a link to the [PCT technique](https://www.tmap.net/wiki/process-cycle-test-pct)
